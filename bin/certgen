# Certgen CLI Entry Point
# This script configures the local runtime environment and delegates to the CLI handler.
# Designed for maximum portability as a standalone Ruby application.
# ---

# Strategic Load Path Modification:
# We unshift the local 'lib' directory into the $LOAD_PATH. This ensures:
# 1. Faster resolution of internal requires.
# 2. Local parity (running bin/certgen always uses the adjacent lib/ code).
$LOAD_PATH.unshift File.expand_path('../lib', __dir__)

require 'certgen'

# Transfer control to the CLI orchestration layer.
# We pass the process-level ARGV to handle user-provided flags and subcommands.
Certgen::CLI.start(ARGV)
